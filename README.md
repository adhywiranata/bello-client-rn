## Setup ✈️

### Installation 🔧

to install this project on your local development machine, make sure you have node.js minimum version of 6, and npm/yarn to run scripts (of course you do have npm 😬).

### Starting Out ⏰

to start the project's development server (to update the js bundle), simply use npm/yarn start. You won't be needing this on OSX, since the packager will automatically be prompted when you start debugging on your device.

### Debugging on Device/Emulator 👷

For now, the app only fully supports Android, although it will work just fine on iOS, with several design aspect limitations and quirks.

react-native run-android
```

## Development 🔧

### Testing 👷

This app uses jest to run snapshot test for React Native and unit test for Redux, as well as integration tests for API integration.
